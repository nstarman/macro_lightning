Constraints from Macro-Induced Lightning
========================================

This repo contains code to reproduce the results presented in [cite paper here]. We calculate the minimum cross-section required for a macroscopic dark matter nugget to initiate a lightning bolt if it strikes the Earth's atmosphere during a thunderstorm. We also calculate the rate of lightning initiation events, given the mass of the macro. This allows us to put constraints on the mass cros-section parameter space based on the non-detection of characteristically straight lightning strikes.


Notebooks
---------

Folder contains mathematica notebooks to compute event rates for macro-induced lightning, as well as the constraints in mass and cross-section, both for lightning events on Earth and on Jupiter. There is also a notebook to compute the fraction of the Maxwell distribution of DM particles with velocities high enough to produce straight lightning bolts (ie. traveling faster than a lightning leader would ordinarily propogate).
