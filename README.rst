Constraints from Macro-Induced Lightning
========================================

Notebooks
---------

Folder contains mathematica notebooks to compute event rates for macro-induced lightning, as well as the constraints in mass and cross-section, both for lightning events on Earth and on Jupiter. There is also a notebook to compute the fraction of the Maxwell distribution of DM particles with velocities high enough to produce straight lightning bolts (ie. traveling faster than a lightning leader would ordinarily propogate).
